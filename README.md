# This project is discontinued, its functions have been integrated into Kit


 ## Running
 If you want to use the bot, invite it with the link below. I would prefer you didn't run your own instance; mostly because one already exists, but no support will be given to you for them, and the bot will quickly become out of date

## Documentation
Command documentation is available within the `k?help` command

## Command Aliases
Some commands have aliases, they are included in `./JSON/aliases.json`.
When an alias is used, it calls the parent command instead

**Aliases:**
```js
{
    "ping":{
        "aliases": ["pong"]
    },
    "8ball":{
        "aliases": ["is", "does", "am", "are", "will", "do", "have"]
    },
    "owo":{
        "aliases": ["uwu"]
    },
    "temp":{
        "aliases": ["temperature"]
...
```
